# Bias and Segregation
Although the inherent bias of the population plays a part in polarization, the algorithmic bias of different social platforms works out in a way that reinforces the inherent biases thereby increasing the chances and rates of polarization or segregation. We are working on different different opinion dynamics models with synthetic and also real data to uncover the cyclic self-reinforcing relationship between algorithmic bias and social segregation.
